## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_TravelPlanner-main.git
cd AI_TravelPlanner-main
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to provide API keys for the services used by the application.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual keys:

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"
    SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_dev_api_key_here"
    ```

    -   **GEMINI_API_KEY:** Get your key from Google AI Studio.
    -   **SERPER_API_KEY:** Get your key from Serper.dev. The free plan is sufficient for development.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser should open a new tab with the application running. Fill in the travel details in the sidebar and click "Generate Itinerary" to start.
